# SIFT Annotated ChestX-ray14 Image Dataset 
Caddie_ChestX-ray14 is the annotated data (label of diseases, location and fine-grained boundary coordinates of labeled diseases, and confidence score of disease from [ChestX-ray14](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/chestx-ray14).  ChestX-ray14 is a publicly available medical imaging dataset which comprises 112,120 frontal-view X-ray images of 30,805 (collected from the year of 1992 to 2015) unique patients with the text-mined fourteen common disease labels, mined from the text radiological reports via NLP techniques. Annotations for ChestX-ray14 were generated by [Smart Imagery Framing and Truthing System(SIFT)](https://github.com/CaddieTechology/SIFT/) which has been successfully to annotate over 100,000  covid-19 radiographs in [MIDRC](https://www.midrc.org) funded by NIBIB/NIH and TB medical images in [TB Portals](https://tbportals.niaid.nih.gov/) of NIAID/NIH.  The Annotation data contains *.json(structured annotation files),*.png(150*150 thumbnails with annotations) and *.xlsm (file lists with annotations).  Several radiologists have randomly examined a few annotation results to assure the quality and accuracy of annotations. Technologies and performance of SIFT has been published in various publications.  The annotation data is intended to train, validate, and test machine learning and artificial intelligence system.

## About The Pretrained Model
The X-ray chest model that detects 65 chest charactors or deseases was trained on more than 1 million images. The performance of main classes as follow:
|Label|ROC|Label|ROC|
|----|----|----|----|
|Tuberculosis|0.996|Nodule|0.940|
|Pneumonia|0.970|Calcification|0.985|
|Fibroproliferative|0.966|Pleural thickening|0.964|
|Aortic Sclerosis|0.991|Rib Fractures|0.962|
|Pleural Effusion|0.982|Fibrosis|0.955|   ``````````````````

## Example Images

## Usage
1. Download chest X-ray images from [ChestX-ray14](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/chestx-ray14)      
2. Download annotations from [Caddie_ChestX-ray14](https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/dataexchange/home?region=us-east-2#/owned/products)  
3. To browse images with annotations you could use thumbnail or download [LabelMe](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme/tree/v4.1.4) repository(V3.16.1-V4.1.4) edition source to build your label tool.   
Fourth, move all you want to label or view images to one folder as the image directory for LableMe, and unzip the downloaded labels as image labels directory. Then you would view and check or modify the image labels.
